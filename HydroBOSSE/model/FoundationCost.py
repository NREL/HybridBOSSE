    \nCalculates the costs of constructing foundations for utility scale solar projects.
    Here, foundations is referring to the concrete pad that holds the inverter +
    transformer container (only).

    Not considered in this module: Racking systems foundation. Ths is done in
    RackingSystemInstallation module.

    * Get number of turbines
    * Get duration of construction
    * Get daily hours of operation*  # todo: add to process diagram
    * Get season of construction*  # todo: add to process diagram
    * [Get region]
    * Get rotor diameter
    * Get hub height
    * Get turbine rating
    * Get buoyant foundation design flag
    * [Get seismic zone]
    * Get tower technology type
    * Get hourly weather data
    * [Get specific seasonal delays]
    * [Get long-term, site-specific climate data]
    * Get price data
    * Get labor rates
    * Get material prices for steel and concrete
    * [Use region to determine weather data]


    \n\nGiven below is the set of calculations carried out in this module:

    * Calculate the foundation loads using the rotor diameter, hub height, and turbine rating

    * Determine the foundation size based on the foundation loads, buoyant foundation design flag, and type of tower technology

    * Estimate the amount of material needed for foundation construction based on foundation size and number of turbines

    * Estimate the amount of time required to construct foundation based on foundation size, hours of operation, duration of construction, and number of turbines

    * Estimate the additional amount of time for weather delays (currently only assessing wind delays) based on hourly weather data, construction time, hours of operation, and season of construction

    * Estimate the amount of labor required for foundation construction based on foundation size, construction time, and weather delay
        * Calculate number of workers by crew type
        * Calculate man hours by crew type

    * Estimate the amount of equipment needed for foundation construction based on foundation size, construction time, and weather delay
        * Calculate number of equipment by equip type
        * Calculate equipment hours by equip type

    - Calculate the total foundation cost based on amount of equipment, amount of labor, amount of material, and price data.
