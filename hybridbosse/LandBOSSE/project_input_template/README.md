# Copy this folder

Copy this folder and move it out of the git repo before you use it. Make sure you set the `LANDBOSSE_INPUT_DIR` to point to the location of this copy of the folder. Alternatively, you can use the `--input` or `-i` command line options to set the path to this input folder.

All the project files should have a name the matches the "Project ID" in `projects_list.xlsx` and should be placed in a `project_data` folder underneath the `projects_list.xlsx` file.
