    Calculates the costs associated with transmission and distribution for land-based
    BESS projects (module is currently based on curve fit of empirical data)

    * Get distance to interconnection
    * Get interconnection voltage
    * Get toggle for new switchyard
    * Return total transmission and distribution costs

    dist_interconnect_mi
        (float) distance to interconnection [in miles]

    \n\n**Keys in the output dictionary are the following:**

    trans_dist_usd
        (float) total transmission and distribution costs [in USD]
