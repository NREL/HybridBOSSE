    - Created by Annika Eberle and Owen Roberts on Dec. 17, 2018

    - Refactored by Parangat Bhaskar and Alicia Key on  June 3, 2019

    Calculates the costs associated with substations for land-based wind projects *(module is currently based on curve fit of empirical data)*


    Get project size (project_size_megawatts = num_turbines * turbine_rating_kilowatt / kilowatt_per_megawatt)
    Get interconnect voltage

    Return total substation costs

    \n\n**Keys in the input dictionary are the following:**

    interconnect_voltage_kV
        (int) project interconnection voltage to substation [in kV]

    project_size_megawatts
        (int) total project size [in MW]

    \n\n**Keys in the output dictionary are the following:**

    substation_cost
        (float) cost of substation [in USD]
