    Assumptions:
    1. System contains central inverters of 1 MW rating each. The inverter being
    considered is a containerized solution which includes a co-located LV/MV
    transformer.
    2. PV array is rectangular in design, with an aspect ratio of 1.5:1::L:W
    3. Trench for buried cables from each string inverter runs along the perimeter
     of the system, and up till the combiner box placed at one of the 4 corners of the
     array.

     Shown below is a crude visualization of solar farm floor-plan considered in
     SolarBOSSE. As mentioned above, the aspect ratio of this solar farm is assumed
     to be 1.5:1::L:W. This is a simple, over-generalization of-course, given that it
     is the 1st version of SolarBOSSE (v.1.0.0). This model is being designed in such
     a way that any future interest to allow the user design project layout will be
     possible.

     Key:
     ||| - 3 phase HV power cables (gen-tie)

     ||  - main project road; assumed to have 20+ ton bearing capacity. Also contains
           trench along both sides of the road for output circuit cables (DC), as well
           as MV power cables from each inverter station going all the way to the
           substation.

     === - horizontal road running across the width of project land. Assumed to be of
           lower quality than the main project road, and not meant to support cranes.
           Smaller maintenance vehicles (like Ford F-150 permissible).

    Module to calculate:
    1. Wiring requirements of system. This includes:
        a. Source circuit cabling (from string to combiner box located at end of each
         row). The combiner box capacity (number of strings per box) is a user input.
        b. Output circuit; from each combiner box to that string's inverter station.
        c. Power cable home run; from inverter/transformer station (where it is
        transformed to MV) to the plant's substation which is located at the long end
        of the plant.
