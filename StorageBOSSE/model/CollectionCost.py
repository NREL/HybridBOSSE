    - Created by Ben Anderson on June 3, 2020

    Calculates the cost of the collection system (cable runs that connect BESS containers to substation)
    Assumptions:
    1. Collection system extends in a straight line from substation to BESS location
    2. BESS containers are in a line, and cables run between them.
       Cables join before run to substation
    3. Cable cost is a constant $/m. Cable sizes are neglected, as the majority of cable costs are from trenching
